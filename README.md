# PrototypeV1

Hi team,

This is what I have for the telementoring project. The prototype has three pages: Present/External User, Login, and Stream.
Nothing much has changed from last meeting. I did a lot of experimentations and research with different APIs, mostly failing to make things work, 
with CSS styling and implementing more features such as a shared canvas, which will be used for telestration, and storing multiple clips in one page.

Everything should run fine if you run selectUser.html on your default browser, and it should navigate you to the rest of the pages.

This is my first repository and I don't know what I am doing. Please let me know if you have any questions about the code or how this
rep is structured. Thanks!

Miguel
