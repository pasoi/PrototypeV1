# PrototypeV1

Hi team,

This is what I have for the telementoring project. The prototype has three pages: Present/External User, Login, and Stream.
Nothing much has changed from last meeting. I did a lot of experimentations and research with different APIs, mostly failing to make things work, 
with CSS styling and implementing more features such as a shared canvas, which will be used for telestration, and storing multiple clips in one page.

This is my first repository and I don't know what I am doing. Please let me know if you have any questions about the code or how this
rep is structured. Thanks!

Miguel
